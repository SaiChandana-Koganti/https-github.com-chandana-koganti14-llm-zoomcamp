# LLM ZoomCamp
# LLM Zoomcamp - Week 1 Experience

## Overview
In the first week of LLM Zoomcamp, I gained valuable insights into Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This course, offered by DataTalks.Club and led by Alexey Grigorev, has been instrumental in expanding my skills in AI and machine learning.

## Key Learnings
- Introduction to LLMs and RAG
- Understanding search engines and document indexing
- Performing searches and query handling
- Using OpenAI API for prompt building and invocation
- Exploring alternatives to OpenAI API

## Practical Experience
- Implemented Elasticsearch using Docker
- Practiced indexing and searching techniques
- Applied filtering methods
- Learned to determine prompt length and token count

## Highlights
The most engaging aspect was learning to leverage the OpenAI API to answer queries through prompt engineering. The hands-on experience with Elasticsearch and Docker was particularly enlightening.

## Acknowledgement
Special thanks to Alexey Grigorev and DataTalks.Club for providing this comprehensive and practical course.

## Next Steps
Looking forward to building upon these foundational concepts in the coming weeks and applying them to real-world scenarios.
